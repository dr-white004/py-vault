# üõí Minimalist Offline Goods Ordering System (PySide6 + SQLite)

This is a lightweight **offline desktop app** with two roles ‚Äî **Admin** and **User** ‚Äî designed for simple inventory management and order generation **without constant internet access**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x** ‚Äì Core language (must be pre-installed)
- **PySide6** ‚Äì GUI library for both admin and user interface
- **SQLite** ‚Äì Embedded database engine (no separate setup needed)
- **PyInstaller** ‚Äì Used to package the user app into a standalone executable

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### 1. **Admin App (`admin_app.py`)**

The admin:
- Logs in using a password prompt
- Adds goods with details (name, color, size, type, and price)
- Automatically stores all entries in a local database (`shop.db`)

> ‚úÖ You **must run the admin app at least once** to populate the database before distributing the user app.

---

### 2. **User App (`dist/` folder)**

Packaged with **PyInstaller**, the user app allows anyone to:
- Browse available goods
- Filter based on attributes
- Select desired items
- Enter their phone number
- Generate a printable/downloadable **invoice** as a text file

> üìù This invoice can be emailed or shared back with the admin using any method (manual, online, Bluetooth, etc.)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Ensure `shop.db` (created by the admin app) is in the **same directory** as the user app executable.
